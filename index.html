    <h1>Sophie Scott's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>Sophie Scott, who is fairly new to living in New York, showcases pockets of nature in the city through documentary and urban photography. I create images that show how third spaces—public places where people can gather outside of home and work or school (which are the first and second space)—remain vital for those surrounded by an urban environment. By focusing on these overlooked areas, I aim to highlight the resilience of both nature and the people who live in the area.</p>
    <p>My work explores community and urban surroundings, showcasing the importance of these shared havens as sites of social and environmental engagement. I am inspired by how New Yorkers find connection within parks, community gardens, and other green spaces. I am also interested in how these spaces existed before the city itself, reminding us that New York was built around and on top of natural landscapes. My photographs trace the tension between nature’s persistence and human influence, capturing the marks we leave on the environment—whether through carved-out paths, repurposed spaces, or informal gathering spots. With this, I encourage viewers to recognize these traces of interaction and to reflect on how urban nature both adapts to and is shaped by human life.
